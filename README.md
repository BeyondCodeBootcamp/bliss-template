## Make it Yours

1. GitHub Templates:
   <kbd><a href="https://github.com/BeyondCodeBootcamp/bliss-template/generate">Use
   this template</a></kbd>
2. Pick a name - probably `blog` (or something else real nice and simple like)
   - (it will deploy to `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>`)
3. **Wait 30 seconds**, and your blog will be ready.
   - See **next steps** in the new README.md!

## Has it been 30 seconds?

Are you seeing this default README after created a new repo from our template?

**Refresh the page** ♻️.

You can also check you <kbd>Actions</kbd> tab. If the automatic configuration
failed
[open an issue](https://github.com/BeyondCodeBootcamp/bliss-template/issues) and
I'll see if I can help.

## What's Next?

A new `README.md` with additional instructions will appear in your new repo
about **30s after** you click
<kbd><a href="https://github.com/BeyondCodeBootcamp/bliss-template/generate">Use
this template</a></kbd>.

It will contain **direct links** into your GitHub Pages Settings to click a few
buttons. No muss, no fuss (and no searching for the right page).

Basically, you'll do this:

- [ ] Enable GitHub Pages for your default branch
  - <kbd>Settings</kbd> ➡️ <kbd>Pages</kbd> (left-hand side) ➡️ <kbd>Branch:
    gh-pages</kbd>
- [ ] Enable GitHub Issues as comments via [utterences](https://utterenc.es)
- [ ] Create your first post using [bliss.js.org][bliss] as a front-end
  - The **New Post** link in the `README` will be pre-filled with your blog's
    repo.

Your site will be available at <kbd>https://{owner}.github.io/{repo}/</kbd>.
